<h1 style="color:red;" align="center">Hello bestie, I'm coming for you.</h1>
<h2 style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">Below is a paragraph on Python vs C.</h2>
<p style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">Although Python and C are both object-oriented programing languages, both have many differences. Python uses compiling and interpretation to read the machine code, so that it can start executing the code. C requires the coder making their own space and many things must be created by type, unlike python which has many "assisted" features hard-driven into the language. Python is slower due to more pre-made features. Both have ups and downs, and in the end, Python is easier to code, but C is faster. Coders have 2 great options.</p>

<h3 style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">In my game, there are 2 players that simulate an NFL game.</h3>
<h3 style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">You guess a number to improve your game score.</h3>
<h3 style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">Higher score wins.</h3>
<h3 style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">There are records for each player, like 3-4-1, etc.</h3>
<h3 style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">There is experience.</h3>
<h3 style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">10 xp levels you up.</h3>
<h3 style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">The higher the level, the better score you get in the simulation!</h3>
<h3 style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">Xp can be earned through games. 4.5 for a win, and 1.5 for a draw or a loss.</h3>
<h3 style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">In the game, crowd noises and an NFL band can be heard.</h3>
<h3 style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">Really, just explore the game!</h3>

<h1 style="color:purple">Below is a short essay for different data structures, queue, stack, set, and deque.</h1>
<h4>The queue data structure works like a queue, what is at the front gets read first, and first to be dequeued. It does not range from smallest to biggest, only first in queue to last in the queue.

The stack data structure works like queue, but the top gets removed, or "pop"ed out first.

A set can work like a binary search tree, "bigger or higher?". No duplicates. It can check if an element is present. It can be an organized set or not. (order number wise)

A deque or "Double Ended Queue" is a type of queue that allows input on a singular side by choice, then is allowed to take from either end in the queue.

These data structures can be checked if empty or full.</h4>
hw for me from my teacher
make a website that shows everything you learned from classes with me
and explains
what kind of game you have made (NFL game)
include pictures.

Search up how to use colours and audio in html and try.
